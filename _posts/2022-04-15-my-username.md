# How did I chose @mbrick2
So I was creating a Scratch Account for School and I needed a username. I liked (and do like) Lego so I decided I wanted the word brick and M is my favourite letter. But then I was hit by an Error. Mbrick was taken so me - being me chose mbrick2.
## My many Alts
I have 10s of Alts but the ones I remember are @mbrick3, @mbuild2, @mbrick2gamer and @-mintleaf-.
